          ðŸŽ‰Leon: At the start of my fitness journey, I remember being confused,
          intimated, and lost on where to start. The fitness world seemed so
          foreign and out of my reach, reserved for only those pre-destined to
          be a part of it. However, it shouldnâ€™t have to be this way, as fitness
          should be an essential aspect of everyoneâ€™s life. The potential
          fitness has to drastically improve someone's life can't be overstated.
          My goal is to foster a positive community for all who have just begun
          their own journeys and guide them down the path as a team. Walking
          down this road with friends along the way makes the journey a little
          bit easier, the challenges a little bit more tolerable, and the
          experience just a little bit brighter.

          ðŸŽ‰Anis: My vision when starting this club was to help create an
          environment where students can safely learn the fundamentals of
          training without confusion or fear of judgment, and to foster a
          supportive gym community that motivates each other. From personal
          experience, I know how intimidating the gym can feel when youâ€™re first
          starting out. But everybody was a beginner at one point, and thatâ€™s
          nothing to be ashamed of. When I first started training I was
          overweight, unathletic, and couldnâ€™t even lift the bar off the squat
          rack. The only reason why I was able to come this far is that I was
          lucky enough to be blessed with a good friend who was there for me on
          my fitness journey. We both suffered from depression and isolation,
          but motivated each other to work out, slowly but surely building our
          strength, muscles, and confidence in the gym. The impact was
          life-changing, not just for our bodies, but also for our mental health
          and well-being. I wish to empower every student to reap these benefits
          as well, no matter where they currently are in their fitness journey.
          My primary methods of training include foundational compound
          free-weight exercises such as bench presses, squats, deadlifts, and
          rows. In addition to this, I also like to teach calisthenic exercises
          such as pull-ups, pushups, muscle ups and front levers.
